# Jack Schaible â€“ Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, built with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my work, skills, and contact information in a modern, accessible, and themeable web app!

## Why I Made This

I wanted a portfolio that:

- Looks great and works well on any device
- Is easy to maintain and extend
- Lets me show off my projects, tech stack, and experience
- Supports dark/light mode with a custom theming system
- Uses modern web best practices (TypeScript, Tailwind, Next.js, FontAwesome)
- Gives me a place to share my thoughts

## Features

- **Responsive design**: Looks great on desktop and mobile
- **Theme toggle**: Switch between light and dark mode, with custom color variables
- **Project highlights**: Quick links to my best work, with live and GitHub links
- **Work-in-progress pages**: Blog, Projects, and Contact pages styled to match the main site
- **Accessible**: All interactive elements are keyboard and screen reader friendly
